# Overview

I have created a simple Car Rental JAVA application that users can interact with to rent a Car ,
the application can rent vehicles,return vehicles and check what is available

# Summary 
i have different classes in my application, such as a class called Cars that havetwo subclasses, Cars and motorcycles
each Car type will have a unique attribute nad methods to handle them. We then have a systemRental that 
will handle the renting operations, allowing users to rent and return a Car while calculating the cost of the rental

# Contents
Vehicle class
- attributes consist of make, model,yea,rentalPrice
- methods: getMake(), getModel(), getRentalRate()

  Subclass(Car,motocycles):
  - inherited from the Cars class

# Preview of my application

Before users get to rent a car they will be provided with the available cars on top and then
they will be given a menua to choose from 1 - 5
